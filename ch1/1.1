1.1.1) What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
A compiler translates source program to executable machine code, while an interpreter analyze the source code and run 
it line by line.

1.1.2) What are the advantages of (a) a compiler over an interpreter (b) an interpreter over a compiler?
(a) Machine code generated by compiler normally runs much faster than interpreter.
(b) Interpreter is easier to debug, as it is run line by line.

1.1.3) What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which the compiler produces assembly language
rather than machine language?
(a) Assembly language is easier to debug.
(b) Assembly language is more portable.

1.1.4) A compiler that translates a high-level language into another high-level language is called a source-to-source
translator. What advantages are there to using C as a target language for a compiler?
There are many compilers for C language. C can be compiled on almost any hardware.

1.1.5) Describe some of the tasks that an assembler needs to perform.
It translates assembly code to relocatable machine code.
