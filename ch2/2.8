2.8.1) For-statments in C and Java have the form:
	for ( expr1; expr2; expr3 ) stmt
The first expression is executed before the loop; it is typically used for initializing the loop index.
The second expression is a test made before each iteration of the loop; the loop is exited if the expression
becomes 0. The loop itself can be thought of as the statement { stmt expr3; }. The third expression is executed
at the end of each iteration; it is typically used to increase the loop index. The meaning of the for-statement
is similar to
	expr1; while (expr2) { stmt expr3; }
Define a class For for the for-statements, similar to class If in Fig. 2.43.

Solution:
class For extends Stmt {
	Expr E1, E2, E3;
	STMT S;
	Label loop_start, after;

	public For(Expr e1, Expr e2, Expr e3, STMT s) {
		E1 = e1; E2 = e2; E3 = e3; S = s;
		loop_start = new Lable();
		after = new Lable();
	}

	public void gen() {
		E1.gen();

		emit(loop_start + ":");
		Expr n = E2.rvalue();
		emit("ifFalse" + n.toString() + "goto" + after);
		S.gen();
		E3.gen();
		emit("goto" + loop_start);
		emit(after + ":");
	}
}

2.8.2) The programming language C does not have a boolean type. Show how a C compiler might translate an
if-statement into three-address code.
Solution:
	emit("ifEqual " + E.rvalue().toString() + " 0 goto " + after);
